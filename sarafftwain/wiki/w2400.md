# Options for Transferring Data

There are three modes defined by TWAIN for transferring data:
* Native
* Disk File
* Buffered Memory

A DS is required to support Native and Buffered Memory transfers.

Get a list of supported transfer modes as follows:

```c#
Twain32.Enumeration _xferMech=this._twain32.Capabilities.XferMech.Get();
```
