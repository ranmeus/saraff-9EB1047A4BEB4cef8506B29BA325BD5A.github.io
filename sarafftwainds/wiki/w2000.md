# Minimal Implementation
This is a simple example of a data source that returns a black square 100x100 96dpi RGB24. You can download full code of a [SampleDataSource.cs](content/Minimal.cs).
## Step 1. Define a class of a Data Source
```c#
[Guid("185C9C7B-E6CA-4D50-8D8F-318809689A25")]
[DeviceProperties(
    96f, /*ICAP_PHYSICALWIDTH (DevicePropertiesAttribute or DataSource.OnCapabilityValueNeeded(CapabilityEventArgs))*/
    96f, /*ICAP_PHYSICALHEIGHT (DevicePropertiesAttribute or DataSource.OnCapabilityValueNeeded(CapabilityEventArgs))*/
    96f, /*ICAP_XNATIVERESOLUTION (DevicePropertiesAttribute or DataSource.OnCapabilityValueNeeded(CapabilityEventArgs))*/
    96f)] /*ICAP_YNATIVERESOLUTION (DevicePropertiesAttribute or DataSource.OnCapabilityValueNeeded(CapabilityEventArgs))*/
[ImageLayout(0f, 0f, 1.04167f, 1.04167f)]
[PlanarChunky(TwPC.Chunky,DefaultValue = TwPC.Chunky)] /*ICAP_PLANARCHUNKY (PlanarChunkyAttribute or DataSource.OnCapabilityValueNeeded(CapabilityEventArgs))*/
[PixelType(TwPixelType.RGB,DefaultValue = TwPixelType.RGB)] /*ICAP_PIXELTYPE (PixelTypeAttribute or DataSource.OnCapabilityValueNeeded(CapabilityEventArgs))*/
[XferMech(File = false)/*ICAP_XFERMECH*/, MemXferBufferSize(64*1024U /*64K*/)/*TW_SETUPMEMXFER.Preferred on DG_CONTROL / DAT_SETUPMEMXFER / MSG_GET operation*/]
public sealed class SampleDataSource:ImageDataSource {
```
## Step 2. Initialize a capabilities
Because in our example uses the fixed values of the capabilities, we set them manually.

```c#
/// <summary>
/// Initializes a new instance of the <see cref="SampleDataSource"/> class.
/// </summary>
public SampleDataSource() {
    this[TwCap.XResolution].Value=new float[] { 96f };
    this[TwCap.XResolution].Value=(DefaultValue<float>)96f;
    this[TwCap.YResolution].Value=new float[] { 96f };
    this[TwCap.YResolution].Value=(DefaultValue<float>)96f;
}
```
## Step 3. Override a OnEnableDS method
```c#
/// <summary>
/// If showUI is <c>true</c>, the Source should display its user interface and wait for
/// the user to initiate an acquisition. If showUI is <c>false</c>,the Source should
/// immediately begin acquiring data based on its current configuration (a device that requires the
/// user to push a button on the device,such as a hand-scanner,will be “armed” by this operation and
/// will assert MSG_XFERREADY as soon as the Source has data ready for transfer). The Source should
/// fail any attempt to set a capability value (TWRC_FAILURE / TWCC_SEQERROR) until it returns to
/// State 4 (unless an exception approval exists via a CAP_EXTENDEDCAPS agreement).
/// Note: If the application has set showUI or CAP_INDICATORS to <c>true</c>, then the Source is
/// responsible for presenting the user with appropriate progress indicators regarding the
/// acquisition and transfer process. If showUI is set to <c>true</c>, CAP_INDICATORS is ignored
/// and progress and errors are always shown.
/// Note: It is strongly recommended that all Sources support being enabled without their User
/// Interface if the application requests (showUI = <c>false</c>). But if your
/// Source cannot be used without its User Interface, it should enable showing the Source
/// User Interface (just as if showUI = <c>true</c>) but return TWRC_CHECKSTATUS. All Sources,
/// however, must support the CAP_UICONTROLLABLE. This capability reports whether or
/// not a Source allows showUI = <c>false</c>. An application can use this capability to know
/// whether the Source-supplied user interface can be suppressed before it is displayed.
/// </summary>
/// <param name="showUI"><c>true</c> if DS should bring up its UI.</param>
/// <param name="modalUI"><c>true</c> if the DS's UI is modal.</param>
/// <param name="hwnd">For windows only - Application window handle.</param>
protected override void OnEnableDS(bool showUI,bool modalUI,IntPtr hwnd) {
    this.OnXferReady();

    base.OnEnableDS(showUI,modalUI,hwnd);
}
```
## Step 4. Override a OnImageNativeXfer method
```c#
/// <summary>
/// Causes the transfer of an image’s data from the Source to the application, via the Native transfer
/// mechanism, to begin. The resulting data is stored in main memory in a single block. The data is
/// stored in the Operating Systems native image format. The size of the image that can be transferred
/// is limited to the size of the memory block that can be allocated by the Source. If the image is too
/// large to fit, the Source may resize or crop the image.
/// </summary>
/// <returns>
/// A image to transfer.
/// </returns>
protected override Image OnImageNativeXfer() {
    // return new image 100x100
    var _image=new Bitmap(100,100,PixelFormat.Format24bppRgb);
    _image.SetResolution(
        (float)this[TwCap.XResolution].Value,
        (float)this[TwCap.YResolution].Value);
    return _image;
}
```
## Step 5. Override a OnImageMemXfer method
```c#
/// <summary>
/// This operation is used to initiate the transfer of an image from the Source to the application via the
/// Buffered Memory transfer mechanism.
/// This operation supports the transfer of successive blocks of image data (in strips or,optionally,
/// tiles) from the Source into one or more main memory transfer buffers. These buffers(for strips)
/// are allocated and owned by the application. For tiled transfers, the source allocates the buffers.
/// The application should repeatedly invoke this operation while TWRC_SUCCESS is returned by the Source.
/// </summary>
/// <param name="length">The length.</param>
/// <param name="isMemFile">If set to <c>true</c> that transfer a MemFile.</param>
/// <returns>
/// Information about transmitting data.
/// </returns>
protected override ImageMemXfer OnImageMemXfer(long length,bool isMemFile) {
    // return new image 100x100
    if(this._imageData==null||this._imageData.IsXferDone) {
        this._imageData=new ImageMemXfer {
            Columns=100,
            Rows=5,
            BytesPerRow=3*100,
            XOffset=0,
            YOffset=0,
            Compression=TwCompression.None,
            ImageData=new byte[3*100*5],
            IsXferDone=false
        };
    } else {
        this._imageData.YOffset+=5;
        this._imageData.IsXferDone=this._imageData.YOffset+this._imageData.Rows==this.XferEnvironment.ImageInfo.ImageLength;
    }
    return this._imageData;
}
```
## Step 6. Use a DataSourceAttribute
```c#
[assembly: DataSource(
    typeof(Saraff.Twain.DS.Screen.SampleDataSource),
    Country = TwCountry.BELARUS,
    Language = TwLanguage.RUSSIAN,
    MaxConnectionCount = 64)]
```
