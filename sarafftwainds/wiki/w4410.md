# OnEnableDS
If showUI is **true**, the Source should display its user interface and wait for the user to initiate an acquisition. If showUI is **false**, the Source should immediately begin acquiring data based on its current configuration (a device that requires the user to push a button on the device,such as a hand-scanner,will be “armed” by this operation and will assert MSG_XFERREADY as soon as the Source has data ready for transfer). The Source should fail any attempt to set a capability value (TWRC_FAILURE / TWCC_SEQERROR) until it returns to State 4 (unless an exception approval exists via a CAP_EXTENDEDCAPS agreement).

**Note**: If the application has set showUI or CAP_INDICATORS to **true**, then the Source is responsible for presenting the user with appropriate progress indicators regarding the acquisition and transfer process. If showUI is set to **true**, CAP_INDICATORS is ignored and progress and errors are always shown.

**Note**: It is strongly recommended that all Sources support being enabled without their User Interface if the application requests (showUI = **false**). But if your Source cannot be used without its User Interface, it should enable showing the Source User Interface (just as if showUI = **true**) but return TWRC_CHECKSTATUS. All Sources, however, must support the CAP_UICONTROLLABLE. This capability reports whether or not a Source allows showUI = **false**. An application can use this capability to know whether the Source-supplied user interface can be suppressed before it is displayed.
## Syntax
```c#
protected virtual void OnEnableDS(bool showUI, bool modalUI, IntPtr hwnd)
```
### Parameters
* **showUI**: **true** if DS should bring up its UI.
* **modalUI**: **true** if the DS's UI is modal.
* **hwnd**: For windows only - Application window handle.

## Examples
```c#
protected override void OnEnableDS(bool showUI,bool modalUI,IntPtr hwnd) {
    try {
        this._Screen=System.Windows.Forms.Screen.FromHandle(hwnd);
    } catch {
        this._Screen=System.Windows.Forms.Screen.PrimaryScreen;
    }
    if(showUI) {
       this._acquireForm=new Forms.AcquireForm(new Forms.AcquireForm.Args {
            Resolution=(float)this[TwCap.XResolution].Value,
            PixelType=(TwPixelType)this[TwCap.IPixelType].Value,
            FeederEnable=(bool)this[TwCap.FeederEnabled].Value,
            XferCount=(short)this[TwCap.XferCount].Value,
            BitDepth=(ushort)this[TwCap.BitDepth].Value
        });
        this._acquireForm.FormClosed+=(sender,e) => {
            this.OnCloseDSReq();
        };
        this._acquireForm.AcquireRequred+=(sender,e) => {
            this[TwCap.XResolution].Value=e.Args.Resolution;
            this[TwCap.YResolution].Value=e.Args.Resolution;
            this[TwCap.IPixelType].Value=e.Args.PixelType;
            this[TwCap.FeederEnabled].Value=e.Args.FeederEnable;
            this[(TwCap)0x8001].Value=(short)e.Args.XferCount;
            this[TwCap.BitDepth].Value=(ushort)e.Args.BitDepth;
            this.OnXferReady();
        };
        this._acquireForm.Show(System.Windows.Forms.Control.FromHandle(hwnd));
    } else {
        this.OnXferReady();
    }

    base.OnEnableDS(showUI,modalUI,hwnd);
}
```
