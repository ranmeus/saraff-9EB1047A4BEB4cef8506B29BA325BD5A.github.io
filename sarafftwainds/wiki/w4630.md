# OnSetupFileXfer
Invoked when a application sets the file transfer information for the next file transfer. The application is responsible for verifying that the specified file name is valid and that the file either does not currently exist (in which case, the Source is to create the file), or that the existing file is available for opening and read/write operations. The application should also assure that the file format it is requesting can be provided by the Source (otherwise, the Source will generate a TWRC_FAILURE / TWCC_BADVALUE error).
## Syntax
```c#
protected virtual void OnSetupFileXfer(string fileName,TwFF format)
```
### Parameters
* **fileName**: File to contain entry.
* **format**: A TWFF_xxxx constant.
